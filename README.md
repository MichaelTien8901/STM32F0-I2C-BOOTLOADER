# STM32F0-I2C-BOOTLOADER
   This project demostrate the bootloader for STM32F0 using STM32F072RB Discovery board.  
When program booting, the bootloader will check if there is EEPROM connected to the specified I2C interface.  
If EEPROM found, bootloader will load the new application.
   Even this bootloader use I2C EEPROM to load new application, it can be easily converted to other booting device, 
UART, SPI devices, for example.  
   
## I2C Circuit

Microchip EEPROM 24C512 used for this project. The following are the pin definition,

## Bootloader

   It is possible to configure bootloader size, application address, boot device hardware I2C ID, 
and even different kind of format.
The folloing is the configuration file 'bootconfig.h'

* Bootloader Size and Application Address 

   Depend on different optimization option, the bootloader size is different.  The boundary can be only on the 
   multiply of flash size(2048 bytes).  The default size for bootloader is 12K, so that the application address is from 0x8003000(page 6).
   If C/C++ compiler optimize option is -O3, is possible to change to bootloader size to 8K, with the following changes in 'bootconfig.h'
   ~~~~
   #define APPLICATION_ADDRESS     (uint32_t)0x08002000
   #define FLASH_USER_START_ADDR   ADDR_FLASH_PAGE_4   /* Start @ of user Flash area */
   #define ADDR_FLASH_PAGE_0     ((uint32_t)0x08000000) /* Base @ of Page 0, 2 Kbytes */
   #define ADDR_FLASH_PAGE_4     ((uint32_t)0x08002000) /* Base @ of Page 4, 2 Kbytes */
   ~~~~

* I2C EEPROM (or other boot device)

   The EEPROM I2C ID is defined 
   ~~~~
   #define I2C_EE_ADDR 0xA0
   ~~~~
   You can change to different one if circuit is different.  The bootloader use the following function to read data for updated application, 
   defined in 'i2c_ee.c'
   ~~~
   //
   // the Generic Stream Reader using I2C
   //
   HAL_StatusTypeDef StreamRead( uint16_t ReadAddr, uint8_t *pBuffer, uint16_t numByteToRead ) 
   {
      return EE_ReadBuffer( I2C_EE_ADDR, ReadAddr, pBuffer, numByteToRead );
   }   
   ~~~
   It is possible to use different kind of method(UART, SPI) just to rewrite the 'StreamRead' function.  

* Intel Hex Format (or different format)

   The updated program is the hex file generated by the Keil compiler. 
   **When you load hex file to EEPROM, make sure to use binary format
   (instead of INTEL Hex format). Only binary format will retain the hex file data.**
   

* Dummy main program

   Before the application loaded, bootloader will run a dummy main program before new application loaded.  
   It is very convenient for debugging.  
   This is defined at *bootconfig.h*.
   ~~~~
   #define Uses_DUMMY_MAIN
   ~~~~
   If **Uses_DUMMY_MAIN** is not defined, the linker optimization will delete the dummy main vector table(at the application area) 
   so that we can concatenate bootloader(without the end of file record) and application program to form a complete program.

## Application 
* Application Load Address

   The application load address are defined in the scatter file *app3000.sct*.
   ~~~~
   ; For direct debugging, use the following two lines  
   ;LR_IROM1 0x08000000 0x00020000  {    ; load region size_region for debugging
   ;   ER_IROM1 0x08000000 0x00020000  {  ; load address = execution address
   ; For bootload application, use the following two lines
   LR_IROM1 0x08003000 0x0001D000  {    ; load region size_region
     ER_IROM1 0x08003000 0x0001D000  {  ; load address = execution address
      *.o (RESET, +First)
      *(InRoot$$Sections)
      .ANY (+RO)
     }
     RW_IRAM1 0x200000C0 0x00003F40  {  ; RW data
        .ANY (+RW +ZI)
     }
   }
   ~~~~
   If bootloader change to size to 8K and application address to 0x8002000, change to scatter file to 
   ~~~~
   LR_IROM1 0x08002000 0x0001E000  {    ; load region size_region
     ER_IROM1 0x08002000 0x0001E000  {  ; load address = execution address
      *.o (RESET, +First)
      *(InRoot$$Sections)
      .ANY (+RO)
     }
     RW_IRAM1 0x200000C0 0x00003F40  {  ; RW data
        .ANY (+RW +ZI)
     }
   }
   ~~~~
   For debugging only, just change back to regular load address and you can use debugger.
   ~~~~
   LR_IROM1 0x08000000 0x00020000  {    ; load region size_region
     ER_IROM1 0x08000000 0x00020000  {  ; load address = execution address
      *.o (RESET, +First)
      *(InRoot$$Sections)
      .ANY (+RO)
     }
     RW_IRAM1 0x200000C0 0x00003F40  {  ; RW data
        .ANY (+RW +ZI)
     }
   }
   ~~~~
   We reserve 0x20000000~0x200000BF(excluded in RW_RAM1) for vector table for application launched from bootloader.
   
*  Remap Vector Table at launched application

   At first line in *main()* function, the following code is used to remap the vector table for launched application.
   ~~~~
   /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
   #define LOAD_ADDRESS  Image$$ER_IROM1$$Base   
      volatile uint32_t *VectorTable = (volatile uint32_t *) 0x20000000;
      extern unsigned int LOAD_ADDRESS;
      if ((uint32_t)&LOAD_ADDRESS != 0x8000000 ) {
         // load vector table
         uint32_t ui32_VectorIndex;
         for ( ui32_VectorIndex = 0; ui32_VectorIndex < 48; ui32_VectorIndex++ ) {
            VectorTable[ui32_VectorIndex] = *(__IO uint32_t *) ((uint32_t) &LOAD_ADDRESS + (ui32_VectorIndex << 2));
         }

         __HAL_RCC_SYSCFG_CLK_ENABLE();
         __HAL_RCC_AHB_RELEASE_RESET();
